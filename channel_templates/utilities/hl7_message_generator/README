This channel is a tool for generating sample HL7 messages. These messages contain the segments and data elements that are commonly sent 
in the supported message types. Messages from production systems will typically omit many data elements that are not required; the optional 
elements included in these sample messages will help you test and validate your interface configuration.

To generate a sample HL7 message, send a message to this channel with the following format:

[messageType]^[eventType]
